# Landingface

<p>A landing page for a website that doesn't have any content in the near future. I tried to make a cute face where the eyes follow the mouse position. If you're on a mobile device, there is an animation of the eyes.</p>
<p>In this project I wanted to challenge myself with working a bit more with the positioning of divs in divs and the after pseudo-element.</p>

## Sources

I didn't know how to let the eyes follow my mouse, so I based my code on:

- [Codepen Maria Tatosh](<https://codepen.io/masha_tatosh/pen/ExawOpB> "Codepen Maria Tatosh")

I didn't know how to detect the device in Javascript, so I used following code:

- [Blogpost attacomsian.com](<https://attacomsian.com/blog/javascript-detect-mobile-device> "Blogpost attacomsian.com")



## What I have learned

- For the first time I tried working with branches in git

- I have a better understanding of how the mouse positioning works

- It was a nice challenge to get the eyes and mouth as I designed in Figma before coding it


## Things I may change in the future

This is just a little in between project. I saw some other examples where the eyes really focus on the mouse position if it's in the center of the screen. At this moment the eyes stare forward. So that's something I could improve.


## Conclusion

> This was a little in between project that was fun to do.
